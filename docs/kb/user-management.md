# User management

## Single Sign-On

An important feature of the Cloudron is Single Sign-On. You use the same username & password for logging in
to all your apps. No more having to manage separate set of credentials for each service!

## Users

You can invite new users (friends, family, colleagues) with their email address from the `Users` menu. They will
receive an invite to sign up with your Cloudron. They can now access the apps that you have given them access
to.

To remove a user, simply remove them from the list. Note that the removed user cannot access any app anymore.

## Administrators

A Cloudron administrator is a special right given to an existing Cloudron user allowing them to manage
apps and users. To make another existing user an administator, click the edit (pencil) button corresponding to
the user and check the `Allow this user to manage apps, groups and other users` checkbox.

## Groups

Groups provide a convenient way to group users. It's purpose is two-fold:

* You can assign one or more groups to apps to restrict who can access for an app.
* Each group is a mailing list (forwarding address) constituting of it's members.

You can create a group by using the `Groups` menu item.

To set the access restriction use the app's configure dialog.

You can now send mails to `groupname@<domain>` to address all the group members.
