## What is Cloudron Enterprise

Cloudron Enterprise is targeted at cloud service providers and medium to large
businesses.

With an enterprise subscription, Cloud service providers can install Cloudron 
on a non-registrable domain like `customer.myhosting.com`. This allows for setups
where you can host Cloudrons under a top level domain for each of your customers
like `customer1.myhosting.com`, `customer2.myhosting.com` and so on.

For businesses, Cloudron Enterprise provides multi-host functionality which
allows for a single Cloudron installation across multiple servers.

Other features of Cloudron Enterprise include:

* White labeling - You can re-brand the Cloudron web interface and emails as your
  own.

* 4-hour response time for support requests

## Installation
