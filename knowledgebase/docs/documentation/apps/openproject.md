## User management

### Cloudron SSO

Cloudron users can login to the OpenProject.
The Cloudron *admin* status however is not carried over to the app, thus it comes with a pre-setup admin account,
which requires a password change upon first login. Check the post-install notes when installing the app for admin account username and password.

OpenProject supports various authentication methods in parallel, this means even when Cloudron SSO is used,
non Cloudron users can still be invited to the app.

### Without Cloudron SSO

The app has a pre-setup admin account, which requires a password change upon first login.
Check the post-install notes when installing the app for admin account username and password.
Other users can be invited or added by this admin.
