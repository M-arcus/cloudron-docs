## Customizing Gitea

[Customizing Gitea](https://docs.gitea.io/en-us/customizing-gitea/) is typically done
using the custom folder. This is the central place to override configuration settings,
templates, etc.

On Cloudron, the custom data folder is located at `/app/data/custom`.

Gitea also supports various [configuration customizations](https://docs.gitea.io/en-us/config-cheat-sheet/).
To add customizations, use the [Web terminal](/documentation/apps#web-terminal) and edit
the file named `/app/data/app.ini`.

After editing, restart the app for the changes to take effect.
