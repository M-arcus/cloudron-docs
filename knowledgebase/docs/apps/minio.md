## Cloudron Backup

Cloudron supports [backing up to minio](https://cloudron.io/documentation/backups/#backing-up-to-minio).
However, this is not the intended use case of this app. Cloudron apps are
backed up automatically and it makes little sense to backup the Cloudron to minio
which in turn is part of a backup.

The recommended use case of this app is to host static assets like images, binaries etc.
