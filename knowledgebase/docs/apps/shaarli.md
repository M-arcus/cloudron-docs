## Browser Extensions

Shaarli's browser extensions currently [do not work](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/shiny-shaarli/hajdfkmbdmadjmmpkkbbcnllepomekin/support) on Cloudron because Cloudron sets the `X-Frame-Options` as
a security measure. A future version of Cloudron might support disabling
this security measure.

## Using the bookmarklet

* Open your Shaarli and Login
* Click the Tools button in the top bar
* Drag the `âœšShaare link` button, and drop it to your browser's bookmarks bar.

You can read more about setting up the bookmarklet in the [Shaarli docs](https://shaarli.readthedocs.io/en/master/Bookmarklet/)
