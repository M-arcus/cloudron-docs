## Admin access

EspoCRM is automatically setup with an admin account.

```
    username: admin
    password: changeme
```

Be sure to change the admin credentials immediately after installation.

To make an existing Cloudron user an admin, set the admin flag under
`Teams and Access Control`. Currently, this requires that the Cloudron user
log into EspoCRM first.
