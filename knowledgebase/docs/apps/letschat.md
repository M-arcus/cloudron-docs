## External user registration

Let's chat only allows Cloudron's users to login and external user registration
is disabled. This is because Lets Chat does not have any form of access control.

## XMPP

XMPP/Jabber clients can connect to Let's Chat at the port specified during
installation time. Clients will need to accept the self-signed certificate
to connect.
