# Pricing & Billing

## Form of payments

We accept Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover.

We do not store any credit card information and all payments are handled through [Stripe](https://stripe.com).

## Billing period

For managed hosting, we charge on a 30 day subscription basis (postpaid). Any charges will be made on the last day
of the 30 day period. Any service can be cancelled at any time, the service will then
be terminated at the end of the current 30 days period.

For selfhosted, we charge on a 30 day subscription basis (prepaid). Any charges will be made on the first day
of the 30 day period. Any service can be cancelled at any time, the service will then
be terminated at the end of the current 30 days period.

## Canceling subscription

Subscription can be cancelled anytime at [cloudron.io](/console.html#/userprofile?view=subscriptions).
Once cancelled, we will stop billing you from the next month.

## VAT & Taxes

For managed hosting customers in the EU, VAT (value added taxes) will be included in the price, the amount depends
on the rate of the country of your billing address. Customers outside the EU won't have any taxes applied.

For selfhosted customers in the EU, VAT (value added taxes) is NOT included in the price. The VAT amount depends
on the rate of the country of your billing address. Customers outside the EU won't have any taxes applied.

## Credit Card Hold & Duration

When you enter a card, we verify the card through our external payment provider stripe.
We will attempt a small hold on your card. This hold will get removed after 7 days.

## Payment failures

Payment failures can be resolved by adding a <a href="/console.html#/userprofile?view=credit_card" target="_blank">new credit card</a>
to your account. As we only allow one credit card per account, you will need to overwrite the old credit card information in your
account page. Our billing system will automatically retry using any new credit card.

## Invoices

Monthly invoices can be download from <a href="/console.html#/userprofile?view=invoice_list" target="_blank">here</a>.
